# Neural Network for Digit Recognition

This project is aimed at implementing a neural network from scratch using only the NumPy library to recognize digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels.

## Overview

In this project, I utilized the power of neural networks to recognize handwritten digits. The neural network is implemented from scratch using only the NumPy library, without relying on any external machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading the MNIST dataset, preprocessing the data, and preparing it for training and testing.

2. **Neural Network Architecture**: Defining the architecture of the neural network including the number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, activation functions, and the training algorithm.

3. **Training**: Training the neural network using the training set from the MNIST dataset to learn the patterns and relationships between the input images and their corresponding labels.

4. **Testing**: Evaluating the performance of the trained neural network on the testing set to measure its accuracy in recognizing digits.

## Requirements
